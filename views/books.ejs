        Python for Everybody<br>
        The goal of this free Python Programming book is to provide an Informatics-oriented introduction to programming. The primary difference between a computer science approach and the Informatics approach taken in this book is a greater focus on using Python to solve data analysis problems common in the world of Informatics. The Python 2 version of the book is still available. You can download this free Python book in PDF, EPUB, and HTML format.<br>

        Clean Code<br>
        One of the best books to learn principles of object-oriented programming, e.g. SOLID principles. This is the book that taught me how to write professional code, like code, which can be read and maintained by a fellow programmer. One of the must-read books for coders of all levels. If you haven't read it yet, this should be the first book you read this year.<br>

        The C Book by Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran<br>
        The C Book is designed for programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high-level procedural programming language.

You should already understand statements, variables, conditional execution, arrays, procedures (or subroutines) and so on.

The book concentrates on the things that are special to C. In particular, it is the way that C is used which is focused on. The book is both informative and a good read.<br>

        C Elements of Style by Steve Oualline<br>
        C Elements of Style is a useful guide which covers the principals of good programming style, teaching C and C++ programmers how to write code that can be easily read, understood, and maintained by others. Whether you are a student or professional programmer, you will benefit from the many tips and techniques for constructing elegant, reliable code.

The book attempts to show readers how to build a good programming style into your code. Since computer reads only the code and the human concentrates on the comments, a good programming style pertains to both parts of a program.r<br>
